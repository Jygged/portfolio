            <p class="summaryText">Summary: The first operation of the series, Dogged Drill part one sees players making a hectic amphibious assault on a hostile airfield housing a HVT. The opening is designed to be cinematic, with effects module ambience and close quarters combat. The mission then shifts into a more dynamic phase, taking advantage of Arma 3's large but detailed terrains to allow the players to decide how they want to approach their primary objective. The mission shifts back to close quarters combat once the players reach the HVT compound.<br><br>
                Objectives:<br>
                Launch mission:Completed by activating the briefing map object.<br>
                Clear Insert Area of Hostiles: Completed by eliminating all enemies in the insertion zone.<br>
                Wait for Airdrop: Completed when airlifted support lands.<br>
                Eliminate HVT: Completed when the HVT is eliminated.<br>
                Extract: Completed when all players are in the extract zone.<br>

            <p class="projectText" >The mission is split into three encounter areas.<br><br>The first area (encounter A) takes place at the insertion point. Firefights here are fast and brutal. Many of the enemies at this location are locked to garrison positions to prevent them from rushing the players.<br><br>Area B is much more open. Hostile squads have been set to patrol area B, and an enemy vehicle lurks towards the southern end of the airfield. H-barriers have been placed in long sight lines to provide the players some hard cover. This area is designed to be dynamic, and features no scripted components.<br><br>Area C features a large enemy garrison and contains the enemy HVT. Players rushing this area will encounter close quarters fighting similar to area A.</p>

            <p class="projectText" >Players start aboard a ship NE of the missions area. Here the players can build their loadouts and strategize. Once the players launch the mission (and are teleported to the mission area during a brief cutscene) most of the ship objects are despawned to reduce the number of scenario objects.</p>

            <p class="projectText" >The players arrive by boat under suppressive fire (delivered via a script module, none of the shots will hit players). Script modules are also used to create a friendly missile strike and smoke screen.<br><br>Enemies are placed roughly 100m back from the beach, far enough that the slope of the hill prevents them from firing on players while they disembark.<br><br>Close range combat makes up the majority of this engagement. Players who have provisioned themselves with grenades will do well here.<br><br>Once all enemies in the area have been eliminated a new objective will prompt players to wait for an air dropped vehicle. This is optional as the objective will complete when the air drop arrives, however the vehicle can be quite useful later in the mission. The vehicle will not despawn and can be used as a respawn position.</p>

            <p class="projectText" >The airfield area is largely open and flat. This area is devoid of mission objectives, however it makes a convenient launch point for a push into the HVT area. Clearing this area also provides players an opportunity to eliminate the hostile vehicle (BRDM-2), lest it hunt them down later in the operation.<br><br>H-barriers provide sight line obstruction and cover in long sight lanes. These barriers can also stop heavy machine gun fire from the BRDM-2.<br><br>A small enemy garrison is stationed inside the old airfield command post. These structures are not present on the un-edited map, and have been placed to provide cover and concealment for players and enemies alike.<br><br>A hostile BDRM-2 sits crewed and ready inside this hangar. Its behavior is not constrained, and it will hunt players once it detects them.</p>

            <p class="projectText" >This group of buildings features a heavy garrison and houses the HVT. Roughly half the hostiles in this area are locked to their garrison positions, and the other half are free to maneuver against players.<br><br>Two enemy squads on trucks will enter the area as reinforcements once the players get within about 250 m of the HVT compound.<br><br>The HVT is guarded by a full weapons team.</p>
