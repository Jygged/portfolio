            <p class="summaryText">Summary: Dogged Drill part two puts the players in as special forces conducting a night time insertion and ambush against an enemy supply convoy. This operation aims to capture that ever so powerful spec-ops vibe, with plenty of opportunities for players to use stealth and surprise firepower to their advantage. This is then turned on its head as players become the targets of illumination flares and a helicopter gunship.<br><br>
                Objectives:<br>
                1: Launch Mission: Completed by activating the boat rack object.<br>
                2: Proceed to Insert Position: Completed by arriving at the insert location.<br>
                3: Clear Outpost: Completed by eliminating all hostiles in the outpost.<br>
                4: Destroy Convoy: Completed by destroying all convoy vehicles.<br>
                4: Eliminate Helicopter: Completed by destroying the helicopter or forcing it to land.<br>
                5: Proceed to Extract Zone: Completed when all players are in the extract zone and the helicopter has been eliminated.<br>

            <p class="projectText" >Players start aboard a ship NE of the missions area. Here the players can build their loadouts and strategize. Once the players launch the mission (and are teleported to the mission area during a brief cutscene) most of the ship objects are despawned to reduce the number of scenario objects.<br><br>Once the players have made landfall they are prompted to hold their fire until a friendly cruise missile strike knocks out enemy communications. This strike is shown to players via a picture-in-picture camera feed simulating a drone. <br><br>The player insertion zone is just north of an enemy outpost atop a hill. Clearing this outpost completes objective #3 and prompts players to move to ambush the hostile convoy.<br><br>The target convoy will remain idle at the enemy base to the south until the players get within ~250 m of the planned route. This provides the players with the illusion of a time limit, without actually enforcing one. Once activated the convoy will proceed along the marked route until engaged by the players. The destruction of the conveys vehicles will complete objective #4.<br><br>Shortly after the convoy is destroyed illumination flares will begin falling around the location of the now wrecked vehicles. These are fired from an enemy mortar positioned to the south. The light from the flares will reveal players not in concealment.<br><br>After about 30 seconds (enough time for players to  react to the flares) an enemy helicopter gunship enters the area. It's a stealth mission now!<br><br>The players will be notified by friendly command that the gunship needs to be brought down before the players can be extracted. Command will also inform players of an enemy weapons stockpile, likely containing AA missiles, that may aid in bringing down the helicopter. This stockpile is entirely editor constructed and is not present in the unedited map.<br><br>Once the gunship is eliminated (either destroyed or forced to land), the players may proceed to the extract zone.</p>
