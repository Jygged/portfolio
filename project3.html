            <p class="summaryText">Summary: Dogged Drill part three follows a more straightforward path than the previous two missions. Players are tasked with disabling a radar station (without destroying it) by sabotaging two nearby power stations. These stations can be knocked out by destroying specific converter boxes found around the stations. This mission is purposefully open ended, and players are free to pursue these objectives however they see fit. Increasing enemy reinforcements and areas of significant enemy presence will be the primary obstacles that players must overcome.<br><br>
                Objectives:<br>
                1: Sabotage Solar Plant: Completed by destroying three transformer boxes within the station area<br>
                2: Sabotage Power Plant: Completed by destroying three transformer boxes within the station area

            <p class="projectText" >Players are free to maneuver to the objectives however they wish, however several zones contain large numbers of respawning enemies. As indicated on the map and in the mission briefing, players are advised to avoid these areas.<br><br>Enemy patrols are likely to spot players at a distance, and most firefights will (unless the players rush in) be long range skirmishes.</p>

            <p class="projectText" >Unlike previous parts of the series, players begin part 3 on solid ground. The starting location, FOB Dalton, is concealed within a forest northwest of the mission area. Here players can edit their loadout and strategize.<br><br>Players are provided with artillery and supply drop support options. After use these supports have a five minute cooldown before they can be used again.<br><br>Players are provided with a vehicle containing supplies for their mission. This vehicle also functions as a respawn point, however the vehicle itself will not respawn if destroyed.</p>

            <p class="projectText">Much of the terrain in the mission area is open. Small hills and the occasional forest are the largest line of sight blockers. Firefights here are completely optional, and it is possible for players to rush past enemy patrols, using distance and speed to their advantage.</p>
