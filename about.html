                        <p>I am an aspiring game developer with an interest in level and narrative design. My interest in game design was kickstarted by the environment design and progression of games such as Halo 3 and TES V: Skyrim. These early gaming experiences shaped my appreciation of environmental storytelling and spatial composition. I am also a ttrpg designer with multiple works in progress, all focusing on bridging the gap between game narration and game mechanics.<br><br>I graduated from Earlham College in 2023 with a BA in Peace & Global Studies. The following year I decided to pursue my passion for game design and enrolled at Indiana University Indianapolis seeking a BS in Media Arts and Science with a specialization in game design. I am currently on track to graduate in the fall of 2026.<br><br>As a hobbyist I've designed numerous multiplayer scenarios for Arma 3 using the built in Eden editor and scripting system. Building these scenarios has provided me not only a creative outlet, but also an opportunity to build my knowledge of level design and scripting. Honing my writing and narrative design abilities has also been a core element of my personal projects. Much of my storytelling knowledge in games comes from ttrpgs and the emergent narratives they foster, and I strive to find intuitive outlets for player agency.</p>
